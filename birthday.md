Happy birthday my baby!!!!
I wanted to wait as long as possible before writing this.
You are the surprise that 2024 gave me and I'm grateful 
to God for that.I`d like to think that our meeting under 
the tree was divinely orchestrated.The universe's way of 
say "You two should be together.".
From not wanting a relationship to being completely swept 
off feet like a princess, I can`t imagine my life now 
without you in it.
Thank you for being a blessing to me. 
Thank you for being yourself,
for caring deeply about me, for supporting me, 
for having my back, for taking care of me (add winking emoji).
I appriciate you so much.
Although, we have had our fair share of ups and downs, 
I appreciate the fact that you`ve stood by me through it all.
I appreciate your forgiveness and the fact that you offered
your heart to me a second time. You have no idea how grateful
I am for that.
